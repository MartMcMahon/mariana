Critical Features For Release
- Polished boss fight


Misc gameplay things that bother me
- We get a bunch of the same sound playing on top of each other with zombies
- Human collision detection doesn't match sprite
- Can't navigate menus with controller
- You shouldn't get duplicate characters


Polish things to add:
- Highlight interactable objects, especially ones in range
- Sort character new level lines by things they say on the first level or when they're alone or something
- Add santa toy bag
- Make baseball bat not a sword sound


Ideas for performance improvements
- Separate custom broadphase system for shadows
- Make walls use lines instead of boxes (at least for shadows)
- A* for AI
- Somehow make raycasting fast, then use it for shadows and AI
- Allow setting resolution/antialiasing


Code cleanliness things that bug me
- Lots of duplicated code in:
  - Projectiles
  - Flesh/Goo/Blood/Impact stuff


Notes From Eric
- AI gets stuck on furniture
- Annoying to not know how much ammo you have
- Survivors are too good of shots
- Now it's too easy
- Health indicator makes it too hard to see
