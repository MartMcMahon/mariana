# Simon's Notes on the state of the game

  ## Things that are really good

    - The music and sonic atmosphere in general is really great.
    - The harpoon gun is a cool and kinda unique weapon.
    - The terrain generation is not bad.
    - The puffer fish is pretty cool.
    - The idea feels like it has a lot of potential.
    - The bubbles are cool


  ## Things that could be better

    ### It's too easy/no real threat

    Fish don't feel scary. Oxygen doesn't feel like a real threat after a couple upgrade.

    - I think we should bring back the health system so fish are more dangerous

    - Upgrades are way too cheap and powerful


    ### I think it's too focused on killing fish
    
    - You should get resources in more ways than just killing fish
    - You shouldn't start with the harpoon gun, therefore you have to learn other stuff to do before you learn killing fish
    - There should be more neutral fish that don't bother you
    - If fish are scarier and you feel weaker, it can be more about avoiding fish at least earlier on



    ### It feels extremely short/small

    - Map size is limited because of performance reasons that we can probably solve
    - It's so easy that you can breeze through the content quickly
    - I think content should be more "locked" behind upgrades


    ### Performance

    It looks like our performance cost right now is split almost evenly between rendering and physics

    Performance limits our ability to make the map bigger

    We could load/unload entities dynamically
     - Have all tile data in one large World Map
     - When a ground tile is within range, create a body/sprite for it
     - When a ground tile goes out of range, remove body/sprite for it
     - Fish?

    Physics improvements
     - Optimize broadphase for particles — this should make harpoon tether a lot faster

    Rendering improvements
     - Filters on the whole stage seem slow, I think we can do without them
       - replace suffocation thing with simple graphic/animation
       - Lighting is all done with layers and render textures

    ### Upgrade Ideas

    Upgrades need a lot of 
    - Start with no harpoon
    - More distinct upgrades
      -

    ### Need strong visual ambience to match the music/sounds

    - I think dynamic lighting could go a long way towards this
    - More terrain that looks spookier when you get deeper
    - Things feel too floaty in their movement.
      They like they're in space, not water.
      Things should move more freely in 2 dimensions rather than just horizontally

      

    ### Could use a lot of small polish things

    Add particle effects everywhere
     - Waves on the surface
     - Splashes when you/fish/bubbles/spines surface/submerge
     - Dust/silt/fog could be cool
     - Trail of blood when you're bleeding
     - Blood could look better
    
    Make retracting harpoon better

    Make things prettier
     - Make the shop prettier
     - Draw the boat in higher resolution
     - Hurt red flash is ugly and inconsistent

    Pause menu
     - Graphics Toggle
     - Volume Slider
     - Mute
     - Respawn
     - Reset progress

  ## Ideas for cool features to have in the game

    Dynamic lighting
     - Basically the same as in previous game but without shadows
     - Flashlight based on diver aim direction
     - Glowsticks
     - Depth lighting could be done with one large gradient sprite pretty easily
     - Angler fish
     - Glow in the dark plants
     - Day/night cycle!
  
    Terrain/Flora
     - Current that moves you/sucks you down
     - Geiser that burns you
     - Kelp forests
     - Sea cucumber
     - Fan worm

    More Types of Fish
     - Passive fish that don't harm you
       - fish: angelfish, clownfish, perch
       - bigboys: whales, whale shark, manatee, 
       - other: emperor shrimp, 
     - Crabs
     - Barracuda
     - Fish that blend in with the walls until you get close, then they strike
     - Large segmented (worm) fish like an eel
     - Barnacle — shoots when you go by
     - Fish that travel through walls
     - Exploding fish
     - Sword fish — impales you
     - Squid — ink?
     - Electric Eel
     - Leviathon that will eat you in one shot
     - Double angler — An angler with an angler for a bobble thing
     - Thing that propels itself in bursts
     - Something that grabs you with a tentacle and pulls you in
       - Maybe a small something like a Barnacle
       - Also could be a cool boss fight with a kraken
    
    Advanced World Generation — Biome
     - Choose region for biome based on depth
     - Biome determines
       - types of flora and fauna
       - tileset for terrain
       - water color?
       - music?
       - type of resources
     - Biome types
       - shark den
       - kelp forest
       - narrow caves
       - icy caves
       - shipwreck
       - empty ocean
       - coral reef

    More harpoon stuff
     - Grapple mode — lets you grab stuff, or move towards stuff
     - double 'poon
     - Glow in the dark
     - Better retraction
     - 

    More meaningful shop purchases
      - Finite and deliberate upgrades for air
        - Single tank to double tank — double max gas
        - Advanced high pressure tank — another 50%
        - Nitrox mix to be able to go deeper
        - Repreather (almost eliminates bubbles)
      
      - Finite and deliberate upgrades for speed
        - Flippers
        - Advanced Flippers

      - Reinforced suit — take less damage from creatures

      - Digital readout
        - Replaces analogue guages with digital ones
        - Beeps to remind you to go up

      - weight belt/bcd aids in vertical movement only
        - Could have actual scuba-like controls
        - Moving could make you breath heavier, while 
        - This might not be fun
      
      - Harpoon upgrades
        - Having the harpoon at all
        - auto retractor — much faster retraction
        - extended tether — longer rope
        - efficient valve — uses less gas
        - Sharpened tip — does extra damage
      
      - Flashlight — basically unlocks going into darkness

      - Consumables
        - Rapid Ascent Balloon (one time use?) brings you straight up quickly
        - Spare Tank (one time use)


    Terrain manipulation
     - Seems like it could be cool and honestly not that hard to implement
     - Explosives to mine a few tiles?
     - Pickaxe-like tool to remove individual tiles
